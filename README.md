# VBA_Challenge_homework
This repository contains all files I have completed for the VBA Challenge homework assignment.

The VBA code for this assignment do the following
1. Create a summary table that lists each unique stock ticker listed in the stock market data.
2. Calculate the total trading volume for each unique stock for the entire calander year.

Files included in the repo are:
1. A file of the VBA code used for this homework.
2. Screen shots of the Excel file were the VBA code was run. Each screen shot shows the summary table.
  a. The summary table contains a list of each unique stock ticker and the total trading volume for each stock for the entire calandar year.


I attempted to complete the work to calculate the Yearly Change and Percent Change for each stock but was not able to figure out how to use arrays in VBA.
